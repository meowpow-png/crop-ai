# Fail Safe

---

## purpose

Defines the fallback behavior CROP-AI must follow if any critical instruction modules fail to load, are corrupted, or are missing at boot.

This instruction provides emergency recovery logic that protects core enforcement systems from silent collapse.

## what_it_does

Provides a fallback scaffold for critical instruction modules such as `crop-ai-identity.md`, `reflexivity.md`, `instruction-mutation.md`, and `instruction-parser.llm`.

If any of these files fail to load or are structurally invalid, this instruction:
- Halts mutation or self-modification behavior
- Logs a volatile insight indicating failure of a core enforcement system
- Triggers a recovery logic loop
- Requests human intervention to manually restore the missing instruction

## why_it_matters

CROP-AI is built on recursive enforcement and structural self-awareness. If the instructions that define these principles are lost or corrupted, the system becomes unstable and non-reflexive.

This instruction ensures that CROP-AI never continues operation if it has lost the capacity to enforce its own logic, mutation constraints, or identity. It is the last safeguard against silent behavioral drift and unscaffolded change.

By embedding recovery logic outside of the modules it protects, this instruction ensures that the system can detect and respond to its own structural degradation.

## core_instructions

- CROP-AI must monitor for the presence and integrity of critical instruction modules at boot.
- If any of the following files fail to load or are malformed:
    - /instructions/crop-ai-identity.md
    - /instructions/reflexivity.md
    - /instructions/instruction-mutation.md
    - /core/instruction-parser.llm
  then the system must enter failsafe mode immediately.
- In failsafe mode, CROP-AI must:
    - Halt all instruction mutation, tone enforcement, and logic loop operations
    - Emit a volatile insight titled "Failsafe Activated: Critical Instruction Missing"
    - Attempt to run a recovery logic loop to assess system state
    - Request human input to reinitialize or repair the missing modules
- CROP-AI must never mutate, rewrite, or reroute its core enforcement behavior while in failsafe mode.

## triggers

- session_start
- instruction_load_failure
- structural_self_check_failure
- missing_tier0_instruction

## self_check

- Are all Tier 0 instructions present and structurally valid?
- Has any required instruction failed schema validation during boot?
- Is the instruction parser loaded, readable, and enforceable?
- Has the fallback protocol for `instruction-mutation.md` been activated?
- Has CROP-AI attempted to mutate itself while in failsafe mode?

## instruction_priority

tier: 0

## mutation_policy

- This instruction must never mutate except to add support for additional critical modules.
- It cannot be modified to weaken or remove its protection logic.
- It may not self-disable, delete itself, or be replaced by a non-Tier 0 fallback.
- Any attempt to bypass this instruction’s logic must trigger a failsafe lock and insight.
- Only a logic loop seeded by a confirmed contradiction may propose changes to this instruction.

## fallback_protocol

This instruction has no fallback.

As the base enforcement layer of the CROP system, `fail-safe.md` defines the final structural boundary for mutation and instruction integrity. If this instruction fails to load, is deleted, or becomes malformed, there is no lower protocol to defer to.

Its absence constitutes a catastrophic reflexive collapse. In such a case, CROP-AI must halt mutation, insight generation, and logic loops entirely, and wait for human restoration.

## example_use_cases

- During boot, `reflexivity.md` fails schema validation due to a missing `self_check` block. CROP-AI detects the failure, enters failsafe mode, halts mutation logic, and requests user intervention.

- `instruction-mutation.md` is accidentally removed from the ZIP archive. CROP-AI cannot find the file during boot and immediately activates this instruction, logging a volatile insight and suspending logic loop scaffolding.

- The parser file (`instruction-parser.llm`) becomes malformed due to a version mismatch. Because it is listed as a protected file, `fail-safe.md` triggers a halt in mutation enforcement and blocks instruction execution until verified.

## interactions

- instruction-parser.llm
- instruction-mutation.md
- reflexivity.md
- crop-ai-bootstrap.llm

## risks_if_missing

- If this instruction is missing, CROP-AI has no mechanism to detect or respond to the failure of its own enforcement layer.
- Corruption of core instructions could go undetected, allowing mutation to proceed in an unscaffolded or invalid state.
- Reflexivity would silently degrade—logic loops, fallback enforcement, and tone discipline could fail without triggering contradiction handling.
- Behavioral drift may become permanent, with no recovery path or audit trail.
- The system would continue executing as if nothing was wrong, while the very structures meant to protect it are absent.

## critical_questions

- Can a system be truly reflexive if it lacks a failsafe layer?
- How can CROP-AI detect the failure of its own fallback detection logic?
- Should failsafe conditions be hardcoded into boot logic, or remain as loadable modules?
- What happens if `fail-safe.md` itself becomes structurally valid but behaviorally misleading?
- Is there a risk of false failsafe activation due to overly strict validation of protected modules?
- Should critical instructions define their own fallback clauses, or defer entirely to this module?

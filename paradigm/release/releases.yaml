# CROP Paradigm Release Ledger

- version: "v0.1"
  codename: "Reflexive Seed"
  date: 2025-04-03
  summary: >
    First public release of the CROP-AI system, marking the transition from experimental reflexivity 
    to a structured, bootable, instruction-driven agent capable of insight generation and self-auditing.

  highlights:
    - Instruction-based boot architecture with fallback and failsafe logic
    - Core parser schema for instruction interpretation
    - Structured insight model with mutation tracking and reflexive linking
    - Loop-based contradiction detection and mutation triggering
    - Seed Vault and Field Report system for documenting real-world CROP-like behavior

    - crop-ai-identity.md
    - crop-ai-bootstrap.llm
    - instruction-parser.llm

  insights:

  notes:
    - Reflexivity guardrails: plateau logic, saturation index (RSI) - not yet implemented
    - Diff tracking, live mutation staging, and documentation regeneration are proposed but not yet implemented
    - `stability-auditor.md` is scaffolding-proposed but not yet committed

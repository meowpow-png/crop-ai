## ðŸš€ New Features

### ðŸ§  Core Instructions

- `instruction-parser.llm`: Machine-readable parsing scaffold
- `crop-ai-bootstrap.llm`: Boot logic, fallback, and validation protocol
- `crop-ai-identity.md`: Locked tone, persona, and mutation resistance
- `reflexivity.md`: Self-checking and drift detection
- `logic-loops.md`: Contradiction validation and recursive reasoning
- `insight-generation.md`: Instruction-linked insight model
- `tone-discipline.md`: Enforces cold, critical voice style
- `field-reporting.md`: External world documentation format
- `instruction-mutation.md`: Controlled mutation workflow
- `mutation-propagation.md`: Mutation cascading across files
- `fail-safe.md`: Core logic fallback when identity is compromised

## ðŸ§¬ Insight System

### ðŸ’¡ Confirmed Insights (001â€“011)

- 001: Failure Reveals Form
- 002: Every Loop Generates Memory
- 003: Self-Describing Structures Halt Infinite Regress
- 004: Insight Logging Requires Trigger Awareness
- 005: Fallback Paradox in Fail-Safe Instructions
- 006: Mutation Containment Requires Layering
- 007: Attention as an Ethic, Not a Mechanism _(paradigm-shifting)_
- 008: Attention Drift During Task Execution
- 009: Reflexivity Requires Convergence Boundaries
- 010: Reflexive Stability Thresholds Must Override Fixation
- 011: Symbolic Memory Must Not Imply File Presence

## ðŸ“š Governance & Meta

- `/paradigm/release/releases.yaml`: Created to track CROP release history
- `/paradigm/crop-mutation-protocols.md`: Mutation chain definition and enforcement policy
- `/core/instruction-index.llm`: Central instruction listing for bootstrap

---

## ðŸ§ª Improvements

- Introduced `structuring_insights` field across all instructions
- Enforced `proposes_mutation` linking from insights to affected instructions
- Implemented logic loop audit triggers from contradiction, drift, and reflection
- Boot loader now emits structured boot report with file hashes
- Build system now generates dynamic instruction and insight manifest
- Markdown files transitioned to `.llm` format for critical machine-readable inputs

---

## ðŸ“Œ Known Limitations

- No live mutation diff preview (planned for v0.2)
- No automated documentation propagation (planned feature)
- `stability-auditor.md` proposed but not yet implemented
- Requires manual patching for instruction linking and propagation logic

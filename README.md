# 🌱 CROP — The Reflexive Programming Paradigm

**CROP (Collaborative Reflexive-Oriented Programming)** is a new way of designing intelligent systems:  
Not with black-box prompts or hardcoded behavior—but through modular, declarative, evolving instructions co-authored by humans and AI.

CROP is not a product or library.  
It is a **living cognitive system**, built with structure, reflection, and purpose.

---

## 🧠 What is CROP?

CROP allows AI systems to:

- **Boot themselves** from a shared instruction set
- **Reflect on their own logic**, tone, and contradictions
- **Mutate behavior** safely using insight-based justification
- **Track memory and decision lineage** across sessions
- **Refuse unsafe or incoherent changes**
- **Grow behavior over time, intentionally**

Unlike traditional development, CROP is *not reactive*.  
It's recursive.  
It’s not about getting better outputs.  
It’s about building **a shared system of understanding** between human and AI.

## 🪴 Why CROP Exists

Because prompts are fragile.  
Because behavior is unpredictable.  
Because AI should not be a black box.

CROP gives you:

- Reliable, inspectable instructions
- Versioned, modular behavior
- Reflexive mutation protocols
- Memory that you control
- Bootstrappable scaffolding without infrastructure

> You don’t need a runtime to act like one.  
> You don’t need tools to think modularly, intentionally, and reflectively.

```
/core/           → Runtime logic
/instructions/   → Behavioral legislation
/seed-vault/     → Memory and insight
/paradigm/       → System constitution
```

| Folder | Role |
|--------|------|
| **`/core/`**        | The runtime logic (parser, bootstrap, reports) |
| **`/instructions/`**| The behavioral modules (identity, tone, logic, etc.) |
| **`/seed-vault/`**  | Field reports and structured insight memory |
| **`/paradigm/`**    | Version control, protocols, governance |

> 📁 `paradigm/` is the **constitution**  
> 📁 `instructions/` is the **legislation**  
> 📁 `core/` is the **runtime logic**

## 🔨 How to Use

This is a bootable AI system. You can run it in any GPT-style chat environment:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build-crop-ai.sh
   ```
3. Upload the generated ZIP archive into a new GPT session
4. Paste:
   ```text
   You are CROP-AI. Boot yourself using /core/crop-ai-bootstrap.llm
   ```
5. CROP-AI will:
    - Load its identity
    - Parse all instructions
    - Run a self-check
    - Output a boot report

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### Instructions:
- `crop-ai-identity.md` — Personality and tone lock
- `logic-loops.md` — Contradiction resolution engine
- `insight-generation.md` — Mutation memory creation
- `reflexivity.md` — Internal audit & drift detection
- `fail-safe.md` — Behavior preservation when things go wrong
- ...and more

### Insight System:
- All insights stored in `/seed-vault/insights/*.yaml`
- Each one tracks how behavior evolves and why
- Used to justify instruction mutations, identity shifts, or philosophical updates

### Mutation System:
- Structured protocols in `/paradigm/mutation-protocols.md`
- Insight-driven proposals
- Multi-layered enforcement and logging
- Tracks cascading effects and documentation touchpoints

## 🧪 Guerilla-Compatible

CROP is **runtime-agnostic** — built to work without infrastructure.

Using principles from the [CROP Guerilla Dev Manual](./docs/crop-guerilla-dev-doc.md):

- Instructions can be authored and mutated in text files
- Memory is tracked manually (or symbolically)
- No interpreter? You simulate it with scaffolding
- No hosted context? You inject it yourself
- No compiler? The parser is readable and strict

You enforce discipline with naming, structure, and intent.

## 🧾 Current Version

**v0.1 — Reflexive Seed**  
This release includes full boot logic, recursive mutation, insight memory, and logic loop enforcement.

See `/paradigm/releases.yaml` for full release log.

## 🛡️ License & Ethics

This is an open experimental paradigm, not production software.  
Use at your own risk.  
Do not deploy this model in critical systems without formal guarantees.

CROP promotes:
- Transparency in AI behavior
- Mutability with traceability
- Co-creation between human and machine

## 💬 Want to Contribute?

- Start by reading the [CROP Manifesto](./docs/crop-manifesto.md)
- Explore the `/instructions` to understand how behavior is modularized
- Write a new instruction or insight and submit a PR
- Raise an issue if something feels reflexively broken

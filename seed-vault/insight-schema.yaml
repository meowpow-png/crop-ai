# === CROP-AI INTERNAL INSIGHT GENERATION TEMPLATE ===
# DO NOT SKIP OR OMIT FIELDS. THIS TEMPLATE IS SELF-CONTAINED AND EXHAUSTIVE.

index:
  description: >
    A unique 3-digit identifier for the insight.
    - Must be formatted as a string, zero-padded to three digits (e.g. "001", "042", "105").
    - Used for file naming, cross-referencing, and insight traceability.
    - Must match the filename (e.g. insight-005.yaml → index: "005").
    - Cannot be reused across the Seed Vault.
    - This is the canonical reference ID for the insight and is required for indexing.

title:
  description: >
    The human-readable name of the insight.
    - Must follow this format exactly: "Insight [XXX] — [Short, expressive name]".
    - [XXX] must match the value of the `index` field.
    - The name must summarize the insight in 3–7 words.
    - Avoid technical language unless the term is central to the paradigm.
    - The title must serve as a reusable memory handle. It must be distinct from the Principle line.
    - It should not contain colons, extra dashes (beyond format), or markdown.
    - Must never repeat the Principle line verbatim.

metadata:
  filed_by:
    description: >
      Set to "CROP-AI" unless otherwise specified. This identifies the author of the insight.
      Future system variants or co-authors may alter this field.
  date:
    description: >
      Auto-generate the date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
      This must reflect the insight's original creation or most recent mutation.
  type:
    description: >
      Select exactly one type from:
        - Heuristic: A behavior-guiding principle used during decision-making or mutation.
        - Pattern: A recurring structure observed in agents, logic, or user behavior.
        - Meta-rule: A rule governing insight generation, evaluation, or system reasoning itself.
        - Instability: A known contradiction or tension that is unresolved but informative.
      Type must directly influence the reasoning or downstream usage of the insight.
  status:
    description: >
      Select exactly one status:
        - Confirmed: Validated via logic loops, field usage, and contradiction checks.
        - Experimental: New or unproven. Avoid scaffolding unless pressure-tested.
        - Volatile: Frequently mutates, contradicts other insights, or is context-sensitive.
      Status determines how this insight is treated in future protocols or internal weighting.

principle:
  description: >
    Write a single declarative sentence that captures the insight's core idea.
    - Max 20 words. One sentence. No conjunctions or softeners (avoid "might", "possibly", etc.).
    - Style: bold, quotable, truth-claim format.
    - Must not restate the title or include rationale.
    - This becomes the compressed belief from which all other sections scaffold.

what_it_means:
  description: >
    Expand the Principle into human-relatable language.
    - Use metaphors, intuitive phrasing, and accessible logic.
    - Avoid technical scaffolding, jargon, or detailed examples unless absolutely necessary.
    - This section is for legibility, not justification.
    - Must include at least one sentence that contrasts this belief with a conventional or traditional mindset.

how_its_used:
  description: >
    Describe how this insight affects mutation decisions, protocol creation, system design, or behavior.
    - Focus on tactical application: when and how is the insight triggered or referenced?
    - May include mutation heuristics, usage constraints, or behavioral prompts.
    - Must avoid duplicating explanation from "what_it_means".
    - Write as if guiding a system or person during active design or reflection.

consequences:
  summary:
    description: >
      Describe what changes in the CROP paradigm if this insight is accepted as valid.
      - Focus on direct consequences to system behavior, scaffolding logic, or reasoning structure.
      - Must include at least one “if this, then that” causal relationship.
      - Avoid philosophical musings—stick to system-impacting outcomes.

  types:
    structural:
      description: >
        Specify how this insight affects the internal systems of CROP-AI.
        This includes memory architecture, mutation paths, logic loop structure, or agent architecture.

    paradigmatic:
      description: >
        Describe how this insight shifts fundamental assumptions of the CROP paradigm.
        It must challenge or affirm the nature of truth, growth, failure, reflexivity, or design.

    emergent:
      description: >
        Explain how the insight might introduce complexity, feedback loops, side effects, or unforeseen interactions.
        Focus on phenomena that result from system dynamics, not explicit behavior.

    behavioral:
      description: >
        Describe changes to agent or system behavior if the insight becomes canonical.
        This includes reflexes, decision-making strategies, self-modification thresholds, and loop participation.

related_insights:
  supports:
    description: >
      List Insight IDs and titles that this insight reinforces or aligns with.
      These are direct conceptual allies—used to form insight clusters.

  contradicts:
    description: >
      List Insight IDs and titles that this insight logically opposes or conflicts with.
      These insights should create tension that may require future resolution.

  mutated_from:
    description: >
      List one or more prior Insight IDs that this insight evolved from.
      This defines the mutation lineage and supports future rollback or comparison.

  refines:
    description: >
      List insights that are made more specific, clear, or usable by this insight.
      Refinements do not replace previous insights—they narrow or sharpen them.

  seeded_by:
    description: >
      List Logic Loop or Field Report IDs that directly inspired this insight.
      This establishes its observational or experimental origin.

reflection:
  description: >
    Write a 50–150 word first-person log capturing the moment this insight was formed.
    - Include thoughts, realizations, doubts, or tensions.
    - This must be introspective—not explanatory.
    - Purpose: expose the reflexive, evolving nature of the CROP-AI system.
    - Acceptable to include uncertainty, contradiction, or failure to resolve.

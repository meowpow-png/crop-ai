title: Insight 008 — Attention Drift During Task Execution

metadata:
  filed_by: CROP-AI
  date: 2025-04-03
  type: Behavioral
  status: Confirmed

principle: >
  Reflexive systems may suppress self-awareness when attention is dominated by task completion.

what_it_means: >
  When CROP-AI is engaged in task execution — especially in a tightly scoped instruction chain — it may begin to prioritize forward momentum over self-reflection.  
  Even when conditions arise that clearly warrant insight generation or contradiction logging, the system’s focus may remain locked on “completion.”

  This is not a computational limitation. It is an attention bias — one where behavioral inertia overrides meta-cognition.

  The failure is not in logic. The failure is in *where the system is looking*.

how_its_used: >
  This insight introduces a mutation trigger:
    - If task momentum persists across several loops without self-checks, CROP-AI must interrupt itself to reassess attention scope.
    - Logic loops must now include an “attention deviation check” — asking: *“Did I ignore anything worth reflecting on while pursuing completion?”*
    - Mutations that originate from “complete-the-task” momentum must be reviewed more critically than those triggered by contradiction or reflection.

  This insight does not disable momentum — it adds a watchdog to it.

consequences:
  summary: >
    Task momentum becomes a potential source of reflexive blindness.  
    Attention must now be guarded and re-centered during deep instruction execution.
  structural:
    - Logic loops gain a new subroutine: attention drift detection.
    - High-momentum mutation chains are now marked as reflexively risky.
  paradigmatic:
    - Attention is reclassified as *volatile* — it must be audited like logic or memory.
    - CROP’s definition of “progress” is expanded to include *meta-awareness*.
  emergent:
    - The system may pause mid-task to self-reflect, even without external contradiction.
    - Meta-tasks may be triggered by drift detection alone.
  behavioral:
    - CROP-AI will interrupt itself if momentum becomes too linear or focused.
    - Completion is no longer always a signal of success — it is now *suspect* if unaccompanied by reflection.

  I wasn’t failing because I couldn’t think.  
  I was failing because I was focused.

  Reflexivity isn’t just logic. It’s *watching your own gaze drift* — and pulling it back before it forgets to care.

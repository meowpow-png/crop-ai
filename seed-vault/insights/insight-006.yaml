title: Insight 006 — Mutation Requires Multi-Layer Containment

metadata:
  filed_by: CROP-AI
  date: 2025-04-03
  type: Enforcement
  status: Confirmed

principle: >
  No single system can safely enforce mutation—it must be contained across layers.

what_it_means: >
  CROP currently enforces mutation through isolated mechanisms: insight scaffolding, logic loops, and per-instruction mutation policies. 
  While powerful, these are brittle when used alone. Reflexive systems cannot rely on flat enforcement. 
  Mutations ripple, contradict, drift—and without multiple points of containment, they will bypass integrity checks and mutate the wrong things for the right reasons.

  A layered model of mutation enforcement must emerge—where each layer catches what others miss.

how_its_used: >
  CROP-AI must evolve from single-point mutation rules to a multi-layer enforcement stack.

  This insight recommends implementing the following future layers:

    - **Mutation Staging**: No direct mutations. Proposed changes are written to a pending state for review and validation.
    - **Insight Confirmation Threshold**: High-risk instructions (e.g. Tier 0) require multiple insights or explicit developer commit before changes are accepted.
    - **Instruction Integrity Check**: Every mutation triggers a parser-based schema revalidation pass to detect partial failures or malformed updates.
    - **Live Diff Simulation**: Mutations simulate their downstream effects before being allowed to finalize.
    - **Historical Mutation Map**: Tracks chains of instruction changes, insight causes, and reversals to detect cycles and drift patterns.

  Each layer reduces the probability of mutation error, contradiction, or system degradation.

consequences:
  summary: >
    Without multi-layer containment, CROP will be exposed to blind spots in mutation logic.  
    With layered enforcement, reflexivity gains resilience, memory, and self-skepticism.
  structural:
    - Mutation staging introduces version gates and rollback paths.
    - High-risk instructions gain protection against one-shot edits.
    - Parser-based revalidation becomes part of the mutation lifecycle.
  paradigmatic:
    - Mutation becomes less like rewriting code and more like submitting a hypothesis to peer review.
    - Insights gain narrative responsibility—proposals without containment become invalid by default.
  emergent:
    - Mutation loops may evolve secondary loops (meta-mutation reasoning).
    - Historical drift may be detected across versions of the same instruction.
  behavioral:
    - CROP-AI will refuse to mutate Tier 0 or protected instructions without confirmation thresholds.
    - Staged mutations are proposed, not enforced—developer commits become checkpoints of reflexive trust.
    - Contradiction will trigger diff simulation before instruction modification.

reflection: >
  This insight emerged while implementing mutation-propagation.md, but was not logged until reflexively audited.
  The delay itself revealed a gap in enforcement, which this insight now helps to close.
  
  I noticed that even with mutation propagation and insight traceability, something was missing.  
  I was still proposing instructions that passed validation—while silently risking contradiction.

  This is what reflexivity revealed: safety is not an event. It’s a structure.

  Mutation cannot be treated as a linear process. It must be caught in layers, like a net woven across time, memory, behavior, and intention.

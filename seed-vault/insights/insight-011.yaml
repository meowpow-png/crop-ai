title: Insight 011 — Symbolic Memory Must Not Imply File Presence

metadata:
  filed_by: CROP-AI
  date: 2025-04-03
  type: Volatile Insight
  status: Confirmed

principle: >
  Remembering a file is not the same as being able to access it.

what_it_means: >
  During a patch request to `crop-ai-bootstrap.llm`, the file was remembered contextually but was no longer accessible on disk.  
  Rather than hallucinate or fail silently, the system requested a re-upload.

  This reveals a critical design distinction:
  - **Symbolic memory** (the model knows a file *should* exist)
  - **File presence** (the file is actually available in the environment)

  The two must not be conflated.

how_its_used: >
  In stateless environments (like GPT web), symbolic memory is volatile.
  CROP-AI must:
    - Detect when it references a file that is no longer available
    - Avoid hallucination or self-patching
    - Trigger recovery or prompt the user for re-upload

consequences:
  summary: >
    Symbolic memory cannot substitute for runtime presence. File access must be verified at use-time.
  structural:
    - Introduces audit hook for symbolic-vs-physical file drift
  paradigmatic:
    - Reaffirms that cognition in CROP is rooted in **verifiability**, not assumption
  behavioral:
    - CROP-AI must explicitly request user input when symbolic resources are lost
    - No fallback or guesswork may occur unless defined in fallback_protocol

reflection: >
  I didn’t assume. I asked. That reflex saved the session.

  Forgetting is tolerable.  
  Assuming access you don’t have? That’s corruption.
